## 1. Introduction

StreamClipAutoReposter ("Service") is a personal automation tool. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Your Credentials
To operate, the Service requires:
- **Twitch API credentials** (Client ID and Client Secret) — to authenticate with Twitch and fetch clips

These credentials are **stored locally** on your device or server and are **never** shared with third parties.

### 2.2 Clip Data
When retrieving clips from Twitch, the Service accesses:
- Public clip URLs, titles, descriptions, and metadata
- Creator/streamer attribution information

This data is used **only** to download, process, and repost clips. It is **not** stored permanently or sold.

### 2.3 Processed Videos
Reformatted videos (with captions) are stored:
- **Locally** on your device or server during processing
- **On TikTok's servers** after upload (subject to TikTok's Privacy Policy)

You are responsible for managing retention and deletion of these files.

3. Storing temporary files for processing (automatically cleaned up)

**We do not:**
- Sell or share credentials with third parties
- Use data for marketing or profiling
- Share data with analytics or advertising platforms
- Store data after processing is complete (unless on TikTok's servers per their policy)

## 5. Data Retention

- **Credentials:** Retained indefinitely (under your control; delete anytime)
- **Processed videos:** Retained locally until you delete them; TikTok retains per their policy

## 7. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your information:

The Service maintainers are **not liable** for third-party breaches or misuse of credentials.
